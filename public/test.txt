The number "e" is defined as the limit of the expression (1 + 1/n)^n as n approaches infinity. 
This constant, approximately equal to 2.71828, is a fundamental mathematical constant in calculus and analysis. 
It appears naturally in many mathematical contexts, including exponential growth and decay, compound interest calculations, probability theory, and the study of continuous change. 
Its significance stems from its role as the base of the natural logarithm function, ln(x), where e^x represents exponential growth or decay at a rate proportional to the value of x. 
The number "e" is also transcendental, meaning it is not the root of any non-zero polynomial equation with rational coefficients.

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. So, the sequence goes: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on.
This sequence was first introduced to the Western world by Leonardo of Pisa, also known as Fibonacci, in his book "Liber Abaci" in 1202. However, the sequence had been previously described in Indian mathematics.
The Fibonacci sequence exhibits fascinating properties and appears in various natural phenomena, such as the arrangement of leaves on a stem, the branching of trees, the spiral shapes of shells, and even in the proportions of the human body.
Moreover, the Fibonacci sequence is closely related to the golden ratio, denoted by the Greek letter phi (Ï†). The golden ratio is approximately equal to 1.61803 and is derived from the ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers. As you go further along the sequence, the ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers approaches the golden ratio. This connection between the Fibonacci sequence and the golden ratio has intrigued mathematicians, artists, and architects for centuries, inspiring their work in various fields.

Fractals are complex geometric shapes that exhibit self-similarity at different scales. This means that as you zoom into a fractal, you'll see smaller copies of the overall shape, repeating infinitely. Fractals are not limited to simple shapes like squares or circles; they can have intricate and infinitely detailed patterns.
One of the most famous fractals is the Mandelbrot set, discovered by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot in the 1970s. The Mandelbrot set is generated by iterating a simple mathematical formula and determining whether the resulting sequence remains bounded or tends to infinity. Points within the Mandelbrot set are colored black, while points outside the set are colored based on how quickly they diverge to infinity.
Fractals have applications in various fields, including mathematics, physics, computer science, and art. In mathematics, fractals provide insights into chaos theory, dynamical systems, and nonlinear dynamics. In physics, fractals are used to model irregular shapes in nature, such as coastlines, clouds, and mountains.
Fractal geometry also has practical applications in computer graphics, where it is used to generate realistic-looking terrain, textures, and natural phenomena in video games and visual effects. Additionally, fractals inspire artists and designers with their intricate and mesmerizing patterns, leading to the creation of stunning artworks and architectural designs.
Overall, fractals represent a beautiful fusion of mathematics, art, and science, showcasing the inherent beauty and complexity of the natural world.
